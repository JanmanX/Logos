# The Logos programming language
The Logos programming language is a hobby language intended for extreme simplicity and
ease of interoperation with the OS.
Currently it supports only the ARM64 architecture, but it is designed to be
easily extensible to other architectures.

## Features
### No types
Everything is 64 bits.

### Extensibility
Preprocess (m4, cpp, etc), assemble  and link any way you like.

You can link it with any library of your chosing. I usually use the Linux C
standard library. For MacOS, a template libc.a is provided in the `libc/`
directory.


## Build (optional)
```bash
pip install build
python -m build
```

## Installation
```bash
pip install dist/logos-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Usage
```bash
python -m logos examples/fib.l -o fib.s
as -o fib.o fib.s
ld -o fib fib.o -lc  # -L libc/macos/arm64 (for MacOS)
./fib
```

## To do
- [ ] Implement optimization step
- [ ] Testing for generated assembly
- [ ] Implement easier way to initialize large arrays with values
- [ ] RISC-V backend
- [ ] x86_64 backend
