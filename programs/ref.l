# Thinking:
# - Stack and Heap is not a thing. Its all just "memory"
# - reg will be a keyword for "fast" operations. The compiler will try to keep this in CPU registers

reg a = 10 			# register type
mem 200 b 		    # On stack. b points to start memory

b[0] = a			    # move 10 into b[0], on stack
